# Algorithm
Collection of pure js algorithms.

##### Tip: Default sort() in JavaScript uses insertion sort by V8 Engine of Chrome and Merge sort by Mozilla Firefox and Safari. It is not suitable if you need to sort large number of elements. So, the solution is to use Quick sort for large dataset. 

## Basic

1. [bubble-sort.js](bubble-sort.js): Bubble sort
1. [insertion-sort.js](insertion-sort.js): Insertion sort
1. [merge-sort.js](merge-sort.js): Merget sort
1. [selection-sort.js](selection-sort.js): Selection sort
1. [quick-sort.js](quick-sort.js): Quick sort
1. [max-sub-array-sum.js](max-sub-array-sum.js): Maximum Sub Array Sum
